##üßæ Yaml
As per their own [website](https://yaml.org), <i> YAML is a human-friendly data serialization
language for all programming languages.</i> It is very light and easy to read and modify by a human and that is why it is often the format of choice for saving application configurations and settings.

### Format
Yaml is inherited from JSON and thus also implements some of its is core functionalities like <b>a key-value pair</b>, various data formats, and collections. In order to denote nesting, yaml uses indentation and therefore does not need braces like JSON.

A simple example of the yaml format:
