#Jigsaw game
Final version look at https://github.com/padjal/SoftwareDesign/tree/master/HW/Jigsaw
This jigsaw game is created as a simplified version of Tetris as part of my university course in software design using Java. 

## Technologies and frameworks
I have used the JavaFX framework for creating the UI of this application. In order to create a meaningful project structure, I have followed the MVVM pattern.

## Getting started
Although you can use Maven to build and run the project on any machine which has a JDK installed, I recommend you clone this repo and open it with JetBrain's IntelliJ Idea IDE for the best experience.

## Documentation
The project documentation can be found [here](#). I am doing my best to always keep it up to date so that there is no undocumented code.
